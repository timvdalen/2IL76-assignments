\section*{Exercise 3}
We came up with a measure for how close a polygonal curve Q is to a point set P.\\

We define the distance of a point $P_1$ in P to a line segment $Q_1$ in Q as \\%tims definitie + uitleg

As not all points have to be close, we came up with a formula that defines the number of nearest points in P we will be looking at for each line segment. We do this in order to reduce noise from outliers. The formula we came up with is: $|P|\cdot \frac{l}{tl}$ where $|P|$ is the number of points in P, $l$ is the length of the line segment in Q we are currently looking at and $tl$ is the total length of the line segments in Q.\\

We wanted large line segments to take into consideration more nearest neighbours than small line segments. This is useful when P is well distributed over Q. See for example figure \ref{fig:line-weight}. Here,
