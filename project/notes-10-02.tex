	\begin{itemize}
		\item We want to focus on the paper that deals with terrain, since that seems to have the most direct practical applications and it forms the basis for the followup paper.
		\item We need do to some extra reading on the topic of computing visibility maps, as this concept is quite involved
		\item We want to research terrain properties as saddle points
		\item We want to read Agarwal et al.
